# Data 4319

This is a repository of all projects created in my senior level DATA 4319 Statistical and Machine Learning course during the Spring 2021 semester at the University of Houston - Downtown. The course focuses on the predictive perspective of statistical pattern recognition as well as the algorithmic perspectives of machine learning, as outlined in the syllabus. Topics include, but are not limited to: essential components of learning, feasibility of learning, linear models (the perceptron learning algorithm, linear regression, logistic regression), deep neural nets, stochastic gradient descent, and modeling with TensorFlow (and Flux).

Files in this repository are of jupyter notebooks that are created from the machine learning algorithms that are learning in class and referenced in various textbooks. This repository contains a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 

The notebook contains machine learning projects in Julia v.1.5.3 and Python v.3.

Python projects in this notebook are made using imported machine learning libraries including Skikit Learn, keras, and Tensorflow. For these projects, we will follow the topics discussed in "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron (2nd Edition). A link to a copy of the book can be found (here).
