# Data 4319

This is a repository of all projects created in my senior level DATA 4319 Statistical and Machine Learning course during the Spring 2021 semester at the University of Houston - Downtown. The course focuses on the predictive perspective of statistical pattern recognition as well as the algorithmic perspectives of machine learning, as outlined in the syllabus. Topics include, but are not limited to: essential components of learning, feasibility of learning, linear models (the perceptron learning algorithm, linear regression, logistic regression), deep neural nets, batch gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent.

Files in this repository are of jupyter notebooks or R markdown projects that are created from the machine learning algorithms that are learned in class and referenced in various textbooks. This repository contains mainly supervised learning algorithms, and one unsupervised learning algorithms. 

The notebooks contain machine learning projects in either Julia v.1.5.3, Python v.3, or R v.4.0.2.
