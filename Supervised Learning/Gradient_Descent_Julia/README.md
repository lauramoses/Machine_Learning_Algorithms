# Gradient Descent

## Contents 
In this notebook, we use stochastic gradident descent and batch gradient descent on an artificially generated function. Then, applications to linear regression are demonstrated on Advertising data, using gradient descent to estimate the linear regression coefficients. 

## Software Requirements
The following packages will be needed to run the code below: 

* Plots [documentation](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/)
* Random [documentationra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/)
* CSV [documentation](https://csv.juliadata.org/stable/)
* DataFrames [documentation](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/)
