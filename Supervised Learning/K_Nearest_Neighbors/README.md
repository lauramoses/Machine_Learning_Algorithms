# K-Nearest Neighbors

This is a project of K-Nearest Neighbors in the (link) dataset. 

* Algorithm concepts used in this model:
  * Selecting data for KNN representation
  * Visualizating the data that is being selected
  * Understanding the distance of the Euclidean formulas for two points
  * Apply and correctly classifying the point selected to the right class
  * Find a k value that produces the lowest error margin as a result
