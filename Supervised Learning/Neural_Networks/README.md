# Neural Networks
This notebook demonstrates a neural network from scratch on the MNIST dataset to correctly predict a hand written number's label from its image features. 

## The MNIST Data Set
The MNIST data set consists of 70,000 images of hand written digits, 60,000 of which are typically used as labeled training examples, where the other 10,000 are used for testing your learning model on. 

## Software Requirements
To access this data set, as well as view the data as an image, we will need the following packages:
* MLDatasets [documentation](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDatasets.jl)
* Images, Testimages, ImageMagicO [documentation](https://juliaimages.org/latest/)
