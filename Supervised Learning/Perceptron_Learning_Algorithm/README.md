# Perceptron Learning Algorithm

First demonstration of perceptron algorithm on the Iris Dataset.

* Algorithm concepts used in this model: 
  * Adjustment of random weights on to various inputs to be applied to all inputs
  * Correctly identifying and classification of different features
  * Understanding the output of a linear regression line function from the weights
  * Apply simple one node of neural networks

Write about algorithm concepts used here.. necessary software packages.. etc.
