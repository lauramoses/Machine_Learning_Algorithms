    "![Example of \"Noise\"](linear_noisy_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Such data is actually encountered often: even though a linear classifier seems appropiate, the data may not be linearily seperable because of outliers or noise. Notably, we proved that the perceptron learning algorithm (PLA) will not converge whenever the training data is not linearily seperable. Thus, we must exclude the PLA from our toolkit in this instance. More specifically, we need solve the combinatorial optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{\\boldsymbol{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}}\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=n}^{N}||\\text{sign}(w^{T}\\boldsymbol{x}_n) \\neq y_n||.\n",

    "Note the in-sample error is given by:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, determining the solution the above mentioned optimization problemn is NP-hard. Thus, we will only approximate the solution the minimization problem. Our algorithm is called the pocket algorithm. Essentially, the pocket algorithm keeps in its 'pocket' the best weight vector encountered up to iteration $t$ in PLA. At the end of the algorithm, the best weight vector will be reported as the final hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pocket Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the pocket weight vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{w}}$ to $\\boldsymbol{w}(0)$ of PLA.\n",
    "1. for $t=0,\\dots,T-1$ do\n",
    "* Run PLA for one update to obtain $\\boldsymbol{w}(t+1)$.\n",
    "* Evaluate $E_{\\text{in}}(\\boldsymbol{w}(t+1))$.\n",
    "* if $\\boldsymbol{w}(t+1)$ is better than $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{w}}$ in terms of $E_{\\text{in}}(\\boldsymbol{w}(t+1))$, set $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{w}}$ to $\\boldsymbol{w}(t+1)$.\n",
    "1. Return $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{w}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The original PLA only checks some of the examples using $\\boldsymbol{w}(t)$ to identify $(\\boldsymbol{x}(t), y(t))$ in each iteration, while the pocket algorithm needs an additional step that evaluates all examples using $\\boldsymbol{w}(t+1)$ to get $E_{\\text{in}}(\\boldsymbol{w}(t+1))$. This additional step makes the pocket algorithm much slower that PLA. Nevertheless, it is a useful algorithm to know about. We will next implement the pocket algorithm to classify hand written images of digits in $\\{1,5\\}$ from the famous *mnist data set.*\n",
