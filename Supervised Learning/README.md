# Supervised Learning

## Definition 
Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression:

* **Classification** - uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.
* **Regression** - used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections. Linear regression and logistical regression are popular regression algorithms.
