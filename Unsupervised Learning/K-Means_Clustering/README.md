# $K$-Means Clustering

## Contents
In this project, artificially clustered data are generated, then partitioned using a from-scratch $K$-means clustering algorithm by identifying $k$ number of centroids, and then allocating every data point to the nearest cluster. 

## Software
For this notebook we will need the following packages:
* Statistics [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Statistics/)
* Plots [documentation](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/)
