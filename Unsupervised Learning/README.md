# Unsupervised Learning

## Definition
Unlike supervised learning, **unsupervised learning** uses unlabeled data. From that data, it discovers patterns that help solve for clustering or association problems. This is particularly useful when subject matter experts are unsure of common properties within a dataset. Common clustering algorithms are hierarchical, k-means, and Gaussian mixture models.

There is one unsupervised machine learning algorithm performed from scratch in this file path. A description of the project is given below:
